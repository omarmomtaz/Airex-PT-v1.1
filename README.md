## Objective
Implement and validate a core subset of the Airex cognitive pillars in a functional prototype to form the foundation of the full AGI architecture.

---

## Project Description
Airex V1.1 aims to build a self-directing learning system. It moves away from task-specific programming and curated datasets. It uses a bio-mimetic core that gains skills on its own.

The system follows a loop.

- It accepts natural language commands.  
- It identifies what it does not know.  
- It learns missing skills through ROS and Gazebo simulation.  
- It refines its capabilities through real execution and critique.

The prototype focuses on four pillars.

- autonomous memory  
- learning roadmap  
- simulated pre-action  
- post-action critique  

The goal is a system that learns complex tasks from voice instruction. Airex V1.1 targets autonomous knowledge acquisition across any domain or physical platform.

# 1. Vision and Core Innovation

## 1.1 Problem Statement
Current AI systems are narrow and brittle. They rely on curated data and explicit programming. They lack the ability to detect their own knowledge gaps, set learning goals, and acquire missing competencies.

## 1.2 Foundational Solution
Airex V1.1 implements a bio-mimetic cognitive core. It accepts a goal, identifies what it lacks, and directs its own learning process. This forms the base for self-directed intelligence.

## 1.3 Core Analogy
The system acts like a developing learner. It builds general-purpose capabilities and adapts to new environments through continuous learning.

## 1.4 Core Innovation: Self-Directed Learning Loop
Airex V1.1 uses a closed-loop process.

- goal interpretation  
- gap identification  
- simulation-based learning  
- real-world execution  
- self-critique  

This forms the base of autonomous skill acquisition.
